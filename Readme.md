SUPERSTORE RFM CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION-COMPLETE PROJECT
OVERVIEW :
 This project focuses on understanding customer purchasing behavior using RFM analysis on the superstore dataset .
 the goal is to identify high value ,loyal,and at risk customer so bussines can make smarter decisions and improve revenue 
the project includes complete EDA ,RFM scoring ,custommer segmentation  and visual insights along with an optional power BI dashboard 
OBJECTIVES 
> analyze customer purchase behavior 
>identify the most valuable and least valuable customer 
>provide actionable insights using RFM segmentation 
>visualize patterns im sales ,profit,and customer activity 
>enable data driven bussiness decision making 
DATASET:
>>THIS DATA SET CONTAINS 
      >98000 ROWS 
      >18COLUMNS 
      >'Row ID', 'Order ID', 'Order Date', 'Ship Date', 'Ship Mode',
       'Customer ID', 'Customer Name', 'Segment', 'Country', 'City', 'State',
       'Postal Code', 'Region', 'Product ID', 'Category', 'Sub-Category',
       'Product Name', 'Sales'
STEPS PERFORMED:
1.Data Cleaning &EDA 
>handled missing data 
>checked and analyzed outliers
>visualized sales and profit by Category 
>generated correlation heatmap
>identified high profit and high loss segments 
KEY FINDINGS :
>technology category has highest salea and profit
>Los Angels is the most profitable city 
>new york shows highest loss
>Top Product by revenue :Canon image CLASS 2200 advanced copier 

2.RFM Calculation 
For each customer ,three key metrices were calculated 
Recency:how many days since the customer last purchused 
Frequency : how many times does the customer made purchase 
Monetary:total amount spent by customer 
RFM scores were assigned using qcut()for ranking 

3.CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION 
 based on RFM scores ,customers were placed into meaning ful segments like :
 >Champions
 >Loyal Customers
 >Potential loyalist 
 >At Risk 
 >lost 
this segment helps bussines to target each group diffrently 

4.VISUALIZATION 
 the project includes several clean and insightful visualizations:
 >RFM Segment distribution 
 >Average Sales by segment 
 >Profit by region

 >Top 10 Highest spending customer 

INSIGHTS :

>furniture category contributes the most losses
